	abstract = {Summary
This work describes the application of a methodology designed to improve the representation of water surface profiles along open drain channels within the framework of regional groundwater modelling. The proposed methodology employs an iterative procedure that combines two public domain computational codes, MODFLOW and HEC-RAS. In spite of its known versatility, MODFLOW contains several limitations to reproduce elevation profiles of the free surface along open drain channels. The Drain Module available within MODFLOW simulates groundwater flow to open drain channels as a linear function of the difference between the hydraulic head in the aquifer and the hydraulic head in the drain, where it considers a static representation of water surface profiles along drains. The proposed methodology developed herein uses HEC-RAS, a one-dimensional (1D) computer code for open surface water calculations, to iteratively estimate hydraulic profiles along drain channels in order to improve the aquifer/drain interaction process. The approach is first validated with a simple closed analytical solution where it is shown that a Piccard iteration is enough to produce a numerically convergent and mass preserving solution. The methodology is then applied to the groundwater/surface water system of the Choele Choel Island, in the Patagonian region of Argentina. Smooth and realistic hydraulic profiles along drains are obtained while backwater effects are clearly represented.},

@article{twarakavi2008,
	abstract = {In the past, vadose zone processes in groundwater flow models were dramatically simplified (or even neglected) due to constraints on computational resources. The one-dimensional unsaturated flow package HYDRUS, recently developed for the groundwater model MODFLOW, was evaluated and compared with other contemporary modeling approaches used to characterize vadose zone effects in groundwater models. Being fully incorporated into the MODFLOW program, the HYDRUS package provides MODFLOW with recharge fluxes at the water table, while MODFLOW provides HYDRUS with the position of the groundwater table that is used as the bottom boundary condition in the package. The performance of the HYDRUS package was analyzed for three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a one-dimensional infiltration experiment; (ii) a two-dimensional water table recharge experiment; and (iii) a hypothetical regional-scale groundwater flow problem. The computational need and modeling efficiency of the HYDRUS package was compared with other relevant MODFLOW packages (VSF, UZF1, and REC-ET). For smaller scale problems (up to two dimensions), the VSF process and the HYDRUS and UZF1 packages performed comparably well in terms of modeling efficiency and simulation times. Because of the high computational demand, it was not feasible to use the VSF process on a typical personal computer for the hypothetical large-scale groundwater problem. The HYDRUS package provided a much more efficient alternative to VSF for this large-scale groundwater problem and could better account for vadose zone processes than the UZF1 and REC-ET packages. For large-scale groundwater problems, the HYDRUS package provides an optimal tradeoff between computational effort and accuracy of model simulations for coupled vadose zone--groundwater problems.},

@article{KIM20081,
	abstract = {Summary
This paper suggests a new approach for integrating the quasi-distributed watershed model, SWAT, with the fully-distributed ground-water model, MODFLOW. Since the SWAT model has semi-distributed features, its groundwater component does not consider distributed parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient. In generating a detailed representation of groundwater recharge, it is equally difficult to calculate the head distribution and the distributed pumping rate. In order to solve this problem a method is proposed whereby the characteristics of the hydrologic response units (HRUs) in the SWAT model are exchanged with cells in the MODFLOW model. By using this HRU--cell conversion interface, the distributed groundwater recharge rate and the groundwater evapotranspiration can be effectively simulated. By considering the interaction between the stream network and the aquifer to reflect boundary flow, the linkage is completed. For this purpose, the RIVER package in the MODFLOW model is used for river--aquifer interaction. This combined modeling is applied to the Musimcheon Basin in Korea. The application demonstrates that an integrated SWAT--MODFLOW is capable of simulating a spatio-temporal distribution of groundwater recharge rates, aquifer evapotranspiration and groundwater levels. It also enables an interaction between the saturated aquifer and channel reaches. This interaction played an important role in the generation of groundwater discharge in the basin, especially during the low flow period. The advanced water transfer method in SWAT--MODFLOW was successfully tested, and reproduced the distributed drawdown and reduced stream flow by pumping with multiple wells. Therefore, when considering discharge to streams, springs or marshes, the use of this model would be beneficial in planning for the sustainable development of groundwater.},

@article{hill1998,
	abstract = {Abstract Nonlinear regression was introduced to ground water modeling in the 1970s, but has been used very little to calibrate numerical models of complicated ground water systems. Apparently, nonlinear regression is thought by many to be incapable of addressing such complex problems. With what we believe to be the most complicated synthetic test case used for such a study, this work investigates using nonlinear regression in ground water model calibration. Results of the study fall into two categories. First, the study demonstrates how systematic use of a well designed nonlinear regression method can indicate the importance of different types of data and can lead to successive improvement of models and their parameterizations. Our method differs from previous methods presented in the ground water literature in that (1) weighting is more closely related to expected data errors than is usually the case; (2) defined diagnostic statistics allow for more effective evaluation of the available data, the model, and their interaction; and (3) prior information is used more cautiously. Second, our results challenge some commonly held beliefs about model calibration. For the test case considered, we show that (1) field measured values of hydraulic conductivity are not as directly applicable to models as their use in some geostatistical methods imply; (2) a unique model does not necessarily need to be identified to obtain accurate predictions; and (3) in the absence of obvious model bias, model error was normally distributed. The complexity of the test case involved implies that the methods used and conclusions drawn are likely to be powerful in practice.},

	abstract = {Integration of models requires linking models which can be developed using different tools, methodologies, and assumptions. We performed a literature review with the aim of improving our understanding of model integration process, and also presenting better strategies for building integrated modeling systems. We identified five different phases to characterize integration process: pre-integration assessment, preparation of models for integration, orchestration of models during simulation, data interoperability, and testing. Commonly, there is little reuse of existing frameworks beyond the development teams and not much sharing of science components across frameworks. We believe this must change to enable researchers and assessors to form complex workflows that leverage the current environmental science available. In this paper, we characterize the model integration process and compare integration practices of different groups. We highlight key strategies, features, standards, and practices that can be employed by developers to increase reuse and interoperability of science software components and systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract:
	Integrated geographic modelling and simulation is a computational means to improve understanding of the environment. With the development of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and web technologies, it is possible to conduct open, extensible integrated geographic modelling across a network in which resources can be accessed and integrated, and further distributed geographic simulations can be performed. This open web-distributed modelling and simulation approach is likely to enhance the use of existing resources and can attract diverse participants. With this approach, participants from different physical locations or domains of expertise can perform comprehensive modelling and simulation tasks collaboratively. This paper reviews past integrated modelling and simulation systems, highlighting the associated development challenges when moving to an open web-distributed system. A conceptual framework is proposed to introduce a roadmap from a system design perspective, with potential use cases provided. The four components of this conceptual framework - a set of standards, a resource sharing environment, a collaborative integrated modelling environment, and a distributed simulation environment - are also discussed in detail with the goal of advancing this emerging field.},

	abstract = {To fill a need for risk-based environmental management optimization, we have developed PESTPP-OPT, a model-independent tool for resource management optimization under uncertainty. PESTPP-OPT solves a sequential linear programming (SLP) problem and also implements (optional) efficient, on-the-fly (without user intervention) first-order, second-moment (FOSM) uncertainty techniques to estimate model-derived constraint uncertainty. Combined with a user-specified risk value, the constraint uncertainty estimates are used to form chance-constraints for the SLP solution process, so that any optimal solution includes contributions from model input and observation uncertainty. In this way, a single answer that includes uncertainty is yielded from the modeling analysis. PESTPP-OPT uses the familiar PEST/PEST++ model interface protocols, which makes it widely applicable to many modeling analyses. The use of PESTPP-OPT is demonstrated with a synthetic, integrated surface-water/groundwater model. The function and implications of chance constraints for this synthetic model are discussed.},

@article{sun2018,
	abstract = {Abstract A fundamental problem in geophysical modeling is related to the identification and approximation of causal structures among physical processes. However, resolving the bidirectional mappings between physical parameters and model state variables (i.e., solving the forward and inverse problems) is challenging, especially when parameter dimensionality is high. Deep learning has opened a new door toward knowledge representation and complex pattern identification. In particular, the recently introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold strong promises in learning cross-domain mappings for image translation. This study presents a state-parameter identification GAN (SPID-GAN) for simultaneously learning bidirectional mappings between a high-dimensional parameter space and the corresponding model state space. SPID-GAN is demonstrated using a series of representative problems from subsurface flow modeling. Results show that SPID-GAN achieves satisfactory performance in identifying the bidirectional state-parameter mappings, providing a new deep-learning-based, knowledge representation paradigm for a wide array of complex geophysical problems.},

We use three-dimensional groundwater flow models for the first time to calculate the magnitude and source areas of groundwater discharge from unconfined aquifers to coastal waterbodies along the entire eastern U.S. We find that 27.1 km3/yr (22.830.5 km3/yr) of groundwater directly enters eastern U.S. and Gulf of Mexico coastal waters. The contributing recharge areas comprised ~175,000 km2 of U.S. land area, extending several kilometers inland.

	abstract = {The Nile Delta is essential to Egypts agro- and socio-economy. Although surface water is the traditional source for Egypts irrigation, the shallow fresh groundwater resources underlying the delta are increasingly burdened by groundwater pumping, which increases interest in the status of the groundwater resources. Groundwater up to three times more saline than sea water was found at 600m depth. The occurrence of this hypersaline groundwater raises doubts on the often-made assumption in the literature that seawater is the only source of salt in the Nile Delta aquifer and makes further investigation necessary. Knowledge on the origin of this hypersaline groundwater is key in assessing the possibility of deep fresh groundwater pockets. In this paper we conducted computational analyses to assess possible origins using both analytical solutions and numerical models. It is concluded that the hypersaline groundwater can either originate from Quaternary free convection systems, or from compaction-induced upward salt transport of hypersaline groundwater that formed during the Messinian salinity crisis. Our results also indicate that with groundwater dating it is possible to discriminate between these two hypotheses. Furthermore, it is deduced that the hydrological connection between aquifer and sea is crucial to the hydrogeological functioning of the Nile Delta Aquifer.},

@article{knowling2019,
	abstract = {The degree with which to parameterize a computer model that is to be used for risk-based resource management decision support has been a topic of much discussion in the environmental modeling industry, and remains a difficult choice facing practitioners. High-dimensional parameterization schemes allow for a more robust expression of model input uncertainty over traditional lower-dimensional schemes, but often incur a higher computational burden and require greater understanding of inverse problem theory to implement effectively. However, a number of significant questions remain, such as: What level of parameterization is needed to adequately express uncertainty for a given decision-relevant simulated output?; and To what extent can a simplified parameterization be adopted while maintaining the ability of the model to serve as a decision-support tool?. This study addresses these questions, among others, by using empirical paired complex-simple model analyses to investigate the consequences of reduced parameterization on decision-relevant simulated outputs in terms of bias incursion and underestimation of uncertainty. A Bayesian decision analysis approach is adopted to facilitate evaluation of parameterization reduction outcomes, not only in terms of the prior and posterior probability density functions of decision-relevant simulated outputs, but also in terms of the management decisions that would be made on their basis. Two integrated surface water/groundwater model case study examples are presented; the first is a complex synthetic model used to forecast groundwater abstraction-induced changes in ecologically-sensitive streamflow characteristics, and the second is a real-world regional-scale model (Hauraki Plains, New Zealand) used to simulate nitrate-loading impacts on water quality. It is shown empirically that, for some decision-relevant simulated outputs, even relatively high-dimensional parameterization schemes (>2,000 adjustable parameters) display significant bias in simulated outputs as a result of improper parameter compensation induced through history matching, relative to complex parameterization schemes (>100,000 adjustable parameters)ultimately leading to incorrect decisions and resource management action. For other decision-relevant simulated outputs, however, reduced parameterization schemes may be appropriate for resource management decision making, especially when considering a prior uncertainty stance (i.e., without undertaking history matching) and when considering differences between simulated outputs that do not depend on local-scale heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Remediation measures are crucial to prevent or reverse seawater intrusion deteriorating coastal fresh groundwater resources. The mixed hydraulic barrier approach, as a combination of positive and negative hydraulic barriers, holds promising advantages especially for arid areas because extracted water provides a resource for injection after treatment. However, transient remediation mechanisms and impact of parameters are still unsatisfyingly understood. Therefore, the feasibility and optimal management of mixed hydraulic barriers as well as a comparison to single positive and negative barriers are explored with a synthetic 2D variable-density model of an already salinated, unconfined coastal aquifer using SEAWAT and FloPy. The hydraulic conductivity, porosity, injection and extraction rate, barrier locations, injection salt concentration, and reduction of pumping stress are varied jointly to determine the parameters' impact and interdependencies. The hydraulic conductivity controls the overall remediation potential as a hydrogeological component. Reduced inland abstractions of supply wells and the injection rates of the positive barrier show the largest remediation effects. However, locating the positive barrier within the salt wedge poses the risk of trapping salt landside. A sole negative barrier did not improve remediation substantially. This study thus shows that remediation with mixed hydraulic barriers can be feasible if implemented according to local conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Reductions in streamflow due to groundwater pumping (streamflow depletion) can negatively impact water users and aquatic ecosystems but are challenging to estimate due to the time and expertise required to develop numerical models often used for water management. Here we develop analytical depletion functions, which are simpler approaches consisting of (i) stream proximity criteria, which determine the stream segments impacted by a well; (ii) a depletion apportionment equation, which distributes depletion among impacted stream segments; and (iii) an analytical model to estimate streamflow depletion in each segment. We evaluate 50 analytical depletion functions via comparison to an archetypal numerical model and find that analytical depletion functions predict streamflow depletion more accurately than analytical models alone. The choice of a depletion apportionment equation has the largest impact on analytical depletion function performance and equations that consider stream network geometry perform best. The best-performing analytical depletion function combines stream proximity criteria which expand through time to account for the increasing size of the capture zone; a web squared depletion apportionment equation, which considers stream geometry; and the Hunt analytical model, which includes streambed resistance to flow. This analytical depletion function correctly identifies the stream segment most affected by a well >70\% of the time with mean absolute error < 15\% of predicted depletion and performs best for wells in relatively flat settings within ~3 km of streams. Our results indicate that analytical depletion functions may be useful water management decision support tools in locations where calibrated numerical models are not available.},

@article{jaxarozen2019,
	abstract = {The modelling of social-ecological systems can provide useful insights into the interaction of social and environmental processes. However, quantitative social-ecological models should acknowledge the complexity and uncertainty of both underlying subsystems. For example, the agent-based models which are increasingly popular for groundwater studies can be made more realistic by incorporating geohydrological processes. Conversely, groundwater models can benefit from an agent-based depiction of the decision-making and feedbacks which drive groundwater exploitation. From this perspective, this work introduces a Python-based software architecture which couples the NetLogo agent-based platform with the MODFLOW/SEAWAT geohydrological modelling environment. This approach enables users to design agent-based models in NetLogo's user-friendly platform, while benefiting from the full capabilities of MODFLOW/SEAWAT. This workflow is illustrated for a simplified application of Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES).},

@article{starn2018,
	abstract = {Abstract Groundwater residence-time distributions (RTDs) are critical for assessing susceptibility of water resources to degradation. A novel combination of numerical modeling and statistical methods allows estimation of regional RTDs with unprecedented speed. In this method, particle RTDs are generated in 30 type locales in the northeastern glaciated U.S. by using automated generalized finite-difference groundwater flow and advective transport models. Targets for statistical learning were created from particle RTDs by fitting Weibull, gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions. Whole-basin flux-weighted RTDs were well fit by one-component Weibull distributions. Flux-weighted RTDs at stressed receptors such as wells often produced more complicated RTDs that required a two-component mixture to fit. A Multitask LASSO regression was trained on the parametric RTDs using hydrogeographic features of the modeled areas as explanatory features. In this way, RTDs are regionalized with mappable physical features such as recharge and aquifer volume. The shape, location, and scale parameters of the parametric RTDs are strongly related to the mean exponential age. The shape parameter of the distribution, which controls deviation from exponential, is additionally a function of aquifer heterogeneity and hydrologic features. Regionalized RTDs provide useful metrics with respect to groundwater lag times and solute loading to streams. The lag time between input and output contained in the RTD is critical to understanding the relation between the land surface and human and ecological receptors.},
